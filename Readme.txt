Howdy.  As my internship has ended and I no longer have a Sun
to develop code on, I'm placing the latest LostLands code here
for anyone interested to look at.

FIrst, the disclaimer: LostLands1.05 was stable on my test site
except for a few nagging bugs.  I highly suggest using the code
from a 'hmmm, so this is how X could be done, let me cut and
paste this snippit of code' standpoint instead of a dropin-compile
and-run standpoint.

A few things that I just started to work on but didn't get to finish,
and might have left some 'headers' within the code are:
	broadcasting channels (rooms that echo to a channel)
	almost finished zedit (minus support for the 'remove' command)
	fully implemented reincarnation (with extra races)

Again, 1.05 wasn't really meant to be distributed, but I lost my 1.04.tgz
file (hit 'rm' in the wrong place).

One last thing... please only add to the credits.  The Circle credits and
the Diku credits must stay unscathed, and I ask that the LostLands credits
be not too much molested as well.  Also, I'd like to ask you to mention
Lostlands and Billy H. Chan (Strom@Lostlands) in the opening sequence
where Circle, Jeremy, Diku, Hans are all mentioned :)  (just a little bit
of 'ego-boosting' for my 'hard work at coding' :)

Since my internship has ended, I cannot devote time to supporting this
code at all unfortunately.  However, I can still be reached for now at
bhchan@csua.berkeley.edu (which isn't too stable a provider) or 
bhchan@po.eecs.berkeley.edu (while I'm still in college)

Anyway, have fun...
