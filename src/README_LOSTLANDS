This is the latest release of Strom's LostLands.

Anyway, things you should know.. don't put this on top of 
existing code... it'll erase what you've done and have only
stuff I've done.... this may be bad for some people....
I've included my Makefile.

What LostLands include:  the OLC that was in the ftp site...
a very basic quest stuff.... addquest and showquest works,
sorta... multiclass, races, reincarnation, semi-working zedit

You'll notice a function in utils.c called CAN_HIT or something
like it... this verifies that a player can kill another player
according to the rules I set down in lib/text/policies....

There's a shit load of changes I've made to stock 30pl8 and I
hope you like them... I included the darn stub files for objs
and rooms in here too.... you need to use them to use the redit and
iedit without causing great disturbances in the force.  When you
make a new zone, simply copy the stubs over, and rename all QQ's to
the zone number.    Using redit/iedit, you can only change existing
rooms and items... adding new items or rooms can cause numeric
misalignment... I don't care, since I'm building from scratch, so I'm
not gonna bother fixing it. :)

I've tried to keep everything coded as easily readable as possible
but I don't make promises....

What you get here includes:
	attacks per round in a skill determined format, but easily
		changed to a level determined format
	attacks per round for mobs...
	a new format for mobs and objs which I'll document later, but
		if you look at the stub files, and db.c parse_mob and
		parse_obj, you should be able to figure it out... it's
		backwards compatible so it'll read stock circle30pl8
		stuff.
	quest bits
	races (8 or 10 of them)
	classes (8 or 9 of them)
	shit loads of spells (I think 85 out of 91 are implemented)
	multi-class system that I hacked together and should probably
		be fixed up, but I'm too lazy and I don't really mind
		the system as it is now because I kinda like it that way.
	ranged attack.... mobs now HUNT the person who shot them... they're
		a little slow though. :(
	mobs that need plus items to damage... items that have pluses...
	room for expansion....
	whatelse?  can't remember.... spells, classes, oh, changed the
		way spec_proc guildguards work as well as practice
		work.   I think it's doc'ed in the code....  There's a
		train proc that allows up'ign of ye 'o attributes... up
		to 25.

the sequent's been off and on lately, but it's normally decently
stable and up...

	Strom's LostLands could be found up and about at:
		ystwyth.wrs.com 4000

IN ADDITION, samedi's olc stuff are not fully included into the distribution.
I don't like the non-menu driven system, so I'll end up writing my own menu
driven Medit.  Zedit is half done at this point.

NOTE: you need extra directories in the lib tree to use aliases and quests.
    The directory structure is just like plrobjs, but called plralias and
    plrquest.... ie: you need directories like plralias/A-E and plrquest/ZZZ

Also, fight.c needs items from 39 to 55 to be declared and used as dummy items
for the damage messages.  I've included the 0.* world files in the latest
distribution.
