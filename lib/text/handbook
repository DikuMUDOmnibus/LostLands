This is the immortal handbook.

Doors must have exists that are directly 'opposite' between two rooms.
Redit crashes system if you create a new room... ask for zone stubs.

Remember: Immortals can lock and unlock any door :)

Don't muck around (including iedit/redit) other people's Zones!
Ask permission before linking your zone to a zone owned by someone else.

Weapons: All weapons shall be created by the Implementor Strom.
Armor: All armor shall be created by the Implementor Strom.
	This includes all wearables except:
		Rings
		Necklace
		Held Items
If you need any weapons or armor for your area, ask the Implementor.


REMEMBER 'nowiz' so you get wiznet messages.
RE: gecho...  ALWAYS preface gechos with "*** <your name>:" of some sort.


REDIT and IEDIT: DO NOT MAKE NEW ITEMS/ROOMS... I put in the stubs for a
purpose, and that is because creating a new item can mess up the numbering
in the save files, which would mess up people's rent.  So, only edit
existing items.  New rooms are the same... do old ones.
