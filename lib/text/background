  In the beginning, there was Midgaard.

  Then, one day, Midgaard was destroyed.

  Now, all who survive do so in Strom's Lost Lands.

  After centuries of peace, the Dwarves declared war against the
Elves.  The leader of the Elves sought the help of the Halflings,
and the Yllantra Collective was formed.
  However, the Dwarves were not without allies.  In a bloody civil
war, the Dark Gnomes left the Gnome Empire and joined the Dwarven 
cause.  Together, the Dwarves and the Dark Gnomes formed the
Druhari Coalition.
  The remaining nations attempted to remain neutral, but factions
formed even within those ranks and individual Humans, Minotaurs, 
and Pixies chose in which side they would register.
