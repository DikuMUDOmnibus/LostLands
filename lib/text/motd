Noticed the MOTD hadn't been updated for a long long time...

Anyway, mortals, here's the deal... we have our first CONTEST!!

We're having a NAME THE CAPITOL contest.   It's simple.  Think
up a good name for the capitol and mudmail it to STROM.  First
price winner gets a free reincarnation.  Second price winner will
be given divine inspiration and raise 5 levels (up to 30, of course).
