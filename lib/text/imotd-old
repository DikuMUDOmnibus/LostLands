Welcome to the long-awaited, oft-belated, highly-rated CircleMUD 3.0!

This is the immortal MOTD -- the file that immortals will see when they
log in to the game.  You should change it to something more interesting
when you get a chance (as well as most of the other files in lib/text.)


ATTENTION ALL CIRCLEMUD IMPLEMENTORS:
   There is now a CircleMUD mailing list available!  So, if you'd like
to exchange ideas, ask for coding help, find people who'd like to swap
areas, or report any BUGS (gasp!) you may find, the mailing list is the
best place to do it.

   The address of the CircleMUD mailing list is circle@pvv.unit.no.
Write to majordomo@pvv.unit.no if you want to subscribe.
